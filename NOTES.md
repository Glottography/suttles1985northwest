# Map extent

The features in this dataset have been digitized from a map that does not necessarily show the
full extent of a language area, because parts of it might have been cropped due to the map section.
This also partly explains larger distance between the language areas reported here and the point
coordinate of the corresponding language in Glottolog (see [here](RELEASING.md)), in particular
for languages also spoken further away from the coast such as 
[Lower Tanana](https://glottolog.org/resource/languoid/id/lowe1425).
